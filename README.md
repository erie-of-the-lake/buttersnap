# Buttersnap

Buttersnap is a BTRFS snapshot tool aimed at maintaining the simplicity of [Timeshift](https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift)'s CLI and configuration whilst supporting user-defined root volumes and subvolumes of any arbitrary name.

Currently, Buttersnap remains in a pre-alpha state, with a majority of the API constructed along with some of the necessary test infrastructure.
